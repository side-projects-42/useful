These tests come from [indexedDBmock](https://github.com/kristofdegrave/indexedDBmock) as of 2015-05-07. The only difference is that I had to change index.html a bit to make it run. Besides that, newer versions of those tests should just work if they're dropped in here and the reference in index.html is updated.

Run these tests in the browser by opening index.html or in Node (using PhantomJS) by running `npm run qunit`.
