# binary tree

write tests for RecordStore, including benchmarks

implement

balance?

---

revisit setImmediate
- *-exception-order race condition
  - on some it's not even a race condition, like idbcursor ones seem to always fail, but idbobjectstore ones are intermittent

test that IDBObjectStore.index returns the same or different IDBIndex depending on situation http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-IndexedDB-20150108/#widl-IDBObjectStore-index-IDBIndex-DOMString-name

Other tests
- ideally run these in the browser (and w3c original ones too)
  - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/72fef91ac1ef679207f51def8133b336a6f6588f/LayoutTests/storage/indexeddb
  - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/tree/master/dom/indexedDB/test

multiple readonly transactions should be allowed to run at the same time (but not readwrite, they should be all alone)

readonly properties need to actually be readonly
- done in FDBCursor
- typescript annotation is easier (like in FDBKeyRange), but not actually binding for compiled JS version

share some code between Index and ObjectStore, like getValue, confirmActiveTransaction, count
- similar thing between open and deleteDatabase
- generic functions to update indexNames and objectStoreNames

break events stuff into separate module, maybe fakeDOMEvents
- readonly properties? hidden/non-enumerable properties?

go through and fix all the left comments (todo stuff)

_ properties should be hidden from standard functions
- object.defineProperty enumerable?

For .filter calls that are deleting items from arrays (such as ObjectStore.deleteRecord) it might be faster to use splice as iterating over the array

btree? slice to add to middle of array is slow http://jsperf.com/splicing-a-single-value/19
- probably best: http://goneill.co.nz/btree.php

what if my backend data storage was async? should make it easier to plug-and-play things besides JS objects

findIndex (and similar) could be replaced by smarter searches, like binary search if we know the list is sorted
- Given an array sorted in ascending order, find the lowest value of i where array[i] >= x
  - use this to replace findIndex in storeInIndex in Index.js
