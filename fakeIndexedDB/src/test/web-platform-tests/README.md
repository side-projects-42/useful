These tests come from [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/IndexedDB), last copied in March 2019 from commit [`5df243654fcf1672d8e76d461d989651d907873a`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/commit/5df243654fcf1672d8e76d461d989651d907873a).

To update them, clone that repo, copy over the IndexedDB folder, remove `converted/`, and run the convert.js script. Assuming nothing substantial has changed in the structure of the tests, that should be all you have to do.
